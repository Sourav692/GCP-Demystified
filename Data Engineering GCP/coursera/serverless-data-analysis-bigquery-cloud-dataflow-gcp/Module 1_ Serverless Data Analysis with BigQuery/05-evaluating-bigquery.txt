So what does BigQuery do? So BigQuery offers us interactive analysis. As you just saw, I was able to go to BigQuery the console and was able to take my SQL query and run it without any pre-preparation of any sort. So it gives you an ability to do interactive ad hoc analysis of databases that can go up to petabytes of data. The BigQuery language itself is standard SQL, SQL 2011. It supports a variety of SQL functions as well, so it's very familiar. So if you know SQL, you know how to use BigQuery. To get your data into BigQuery, you have a variety of ways to ingest data, you have a variety of ways of transform, load, and export data to and from BigQuery. There's a lot of tools out there that have connectors into BigQuery. So whether you're using Tableau or using Looker or you using Qlik or using Data Studio, they all have connectors into BigQuery. And more and more partners are creating connectors to BigQuery so BigQuery is one of those tools that allows you to basically, now you can continue using the tools that you're familiar with and still get all the advantages of BigQuery. It supports nested and repeated fields. So beyond just SQL, you also have ways of ingesting, for example, JSON, right? So JSON, because JSON's a hierarchical data format, many of the logs may come in as JSON. No problem, you can ingest them into the BigQuery, you can query them with a SQL language – obviously it's not standard SQL at that point because there are some extensions to help you deal with nested and repeated fields. And the thing about BigQuery is it separates out storage and compute, so you're essentially paying for storage for the data that you put but the cost of storage in BigQuery is about the same as the cost of storage in Google Cloud Storage, so you don't really need to choose. You can store your data, if it's structured data, it's tabular data, store it in BigQuery and you will get the same sort of discounts that you get in Cloud Storage as well. So if you have some data and you haven't edited it in a few weeks, you start getting automatically the discounted rates for older data. So you don't have to worry that, oh, I'm putting my data into BigQuery and therefore I don't get the kinds of discounts that I get with Nearline etc. – you will get those. So BigQuery is a great choice because it allows you near real time analysis. Again, we were able to take that Medicare dataset and were able to do our analysis and we got our results back in seconds. Now it's not totally real time, so if you want a transactional database that gives you millisecond, microsecond responses, BigQuery's not the answer for that. The answer for that would be something like Cloud SQL, or something like Spanner. But for ad hoc analysis of very large datasets, for data warehousing, for business intelligence, those kinds of operations, BigQuery is a great choice. BigQuery is completely no-ops, right? You put your data onto BigQuery, you're not managing any clusters beyond that point. So you want to run a query on BigQuery, you just run the query on BigQuery. You don't need to create a cluster ahead of time. And you only pay when you query the data. I mean, you do pay for the storage but as we all know, storage is cheap, right? So you're essentially paying for the queries that you run. It is possible for you if you want, to basically get a flat rate pricing as well. So you have two forms of pricing in BigQuery, you have the pay for use and you have the flat rate pricing. But really I recommend that you try out the pay for use because it helps you deal with these very rarely used datasets business intelligence sums. And then you can set billing limits and if you find that your bills are pretty high. Then you could talk to your sales people, figure out a way to get on to the flat rate plan. But by default, I think, the best plan for most people tends to be the pay per use.

Now BigQuery, just like cloud storage, is durable, right? So if you put your data on BigQuery it's replicated in multiple places and it's pretty inexpensive, in terms of storing. And BigQuery gives you immutable audit logs. So you know, once you have your data onto BigQuery, you know every time somebody runs a query on it and you basically get those audit logs. Those audit logs can't be tampered with, so you know whenever someone has actually used this dataset or they've edited this dataset in any way.

But the key thing, the thing that is kind of something that's really hard to explain. It's one of those things that after a while you completely get it when you start using it, is that BigQuery is a way for you to share data beyond the silos of your company's structure.

What I mean by that? What I mean here is, because BigQuery is clusterless, right? So you just put your data in BigQuery and you can do ad hoc queries on it, you can take your BigQuery dataset and you can share it with somebody else in your company. Or if you want, you can share it with anybody at your company's domain.

And what this means is that, that person, when they want to do a query on your data, didn't need to ask for permission. They can just go ahead and do an ad hoc query on it, right? Because you have given them this access. Of course you can control access if you need to. But the point being that anybody that you have allowed to access your table, is able to access your table without any of the ops that you're typically required to do. They don't need to think about how do I log into this person's cluster so I can use their data? Well, it's completely cluster free, right? So what this means is that they can take their data. They can mash it up with your data. And what happens after a while is that BigQuery becomes this

form by which you get data collaboration across your company and not just data. I work at Google and part of the cool stuff is every once in a while I'll ask someone. Hey, I'm doing these Coursera courses, how many people are taking this course but not finishing it? And the answer will never be this is x number of people. Instead the person I asked it to would say what are you doing? Here's a query, right? Don't ask me ever again, right? So they send me a link to a query. And whenever I'm curious, I just click that link, and that query runs on BigQuery and I get the answer.

So it's a cool way of sharing not just datasets, but it's a way of sharing your analysis as well. And that analysis can be live, you can share queries. So BigQuery is beyond just the fact of you can go ahead and you can run queries yourself. It's a way of collaboration and that's one of those things that's hard to explain. But after a while when you have lived it, when you're using it everyday and there is this statistic that says something like 70, 80% I'm not sure which one, of all Googlers use BigQuery at least once a week, right? So this is across Google, so it's not just engineers, it's not just data analysts, it's everybody.
