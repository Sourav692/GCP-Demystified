In this first course of the data engineer track, you will gain an overview of the data and machine learning parts of Google Cloud platform, and not just a cursory overview. So what you're going to be doing is in each module, everything is going to be two pronged. At one level we will look at some products that will help you accomplish certain things on Google Cloud, but at the same time, we look at very specific use cases, very common use cases that involve machine learning, that involve data processing, that involve data analysis. So we look at how to accomplish those use cases using this particular products, and we'll do this over and over again. And by the time we are done with this course, you will have basically gotten a pretty good overview of all the moving parts of the data and ML parts of the platform.
