So, who's a data engineer? A data engineer is someone who enables decision making, typically they do this by building data pipelines by ingesting data, processing data, building tools to analyze data, building dashboards, building machine learning models. So, a data engineer's job is to enable decision-making within the company in a very systematic way. And in order to be a good data engineer, you needed to know both programming and statistics to a great deal of depth. But with the advent of Cloud services. Particularly the fully managed, auto-scaling services on Google Cloud. The amount of infrastructure that you need to know, the amount of programming that you need to know has gotten a lot simpler. At the same time, the statistics realm has also gotten a lot simpler. You now have libraries that take care of a lot of the load level program that you have to do. And a lot of the mathematical concepts that you had to know. To the extent that you can now program with data. You can build statistical machine learning models a lot simpler. When you're building, using these libraries and packages. So, what is happen is that over time, the amount of programming the unit you needed to know has gotten simplified. The amount of Statistics that you need to know has gotten simplified. And what that means, is now that you can now look at somebody with skills of a data engineer who can now build these data pipelines. And go all the way to building statistical machine learning models. So, that's what we're going to be talking about in these sets of courses.
