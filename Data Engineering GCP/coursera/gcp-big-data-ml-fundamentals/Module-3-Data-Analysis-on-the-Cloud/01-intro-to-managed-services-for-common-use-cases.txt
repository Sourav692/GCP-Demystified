In this module, we'll look at how to do data analysis on the Cloud using tools that you're probably familiar with, using a relational database and using the big data tools that are part of the Hadoop ecosystem.

In particular, a Spark program and migrate it so that you can run those programs on Google Cloud. Essentially what Google Cloud provides you in those cases are managed services. So, we will look at managed services for common use cases.
