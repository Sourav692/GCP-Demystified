Let's start talking about the Foundations of GCP. And the foundations of GCP lies with its computing and storage infrastructure. Any computer consists of computing, and storage, and networking to connect the computing in storage. The Cloud computer, is also a computer. It's a global computer, but it also contains a compute engine. It contains storage and networking that you don't directly interact with, but networking that's there in any case, for you to connect the computing that you are doing with your data that you have stored. So in this module we look at the foundations of Google Cloud Platform, the compute engine and cloud storage.
