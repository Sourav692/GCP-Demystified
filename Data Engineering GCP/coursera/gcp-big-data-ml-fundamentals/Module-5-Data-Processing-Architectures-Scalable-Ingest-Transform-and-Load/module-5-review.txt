So quick module review. We looked at two use cases, the way to decouple producers and consumers of data in complex systems in larger organizations is Pub/Sub. And the way to create scaleable, fault-tolerant multi-step processing of data is Cloud Dataflow. I know we've gone through these very quickly. We just talked about the system architecture. Come take the data engineer course, and you'll be able to get deeper hands-on experience with both of these products.
