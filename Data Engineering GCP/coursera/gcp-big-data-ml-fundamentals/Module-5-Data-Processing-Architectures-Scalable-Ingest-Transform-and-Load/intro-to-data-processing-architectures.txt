In this last module of the class, we'll do a very quick overview of message-oriented architectures and serverless data pipelines. We will look at serverless data pipelines, in particular cloud data flow, in a lot more detail in the course on serverless data analysis, which is part of the data engineer track. In this module though, we will look at it very, very briefly, very quickly. So you know what it is and you know where to find it if you need it.
