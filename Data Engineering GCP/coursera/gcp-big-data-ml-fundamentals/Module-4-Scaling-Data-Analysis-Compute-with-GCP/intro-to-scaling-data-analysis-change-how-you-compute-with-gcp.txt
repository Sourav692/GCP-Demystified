Scaling Data Analysis. In this module, we look at things that are more transformational, things that you may not have done exactly the same way before. So we'll start out by looking at how to do fast random access. And if you're looking at fast random access, you need fast querying. You've probably used the relational database before, we look at other options, and how you can accomplish them on Google Cloud. Similarly, we look at how to do interactive, iterative development, but to do all of your processing on the Cloud using a notebook format.

Then, we look at how to warehouse your data, and to carry out interactive querying of extremely large datasets, of petabytes scale datasets, but still do your querying interactively. And having done that, the next thing that we look at, and continuing on this whole idea of doing the things that are transformational, is that we look at transfer flow, and how you can do machine learning with transfer flow, again, on Google Cloud. And then, finally, we will look at pre-built machine learning models that are available. That you could take those machine learning models and interpret them into your own applications.
