In this module, we'll talk about what machine learning is, how to build effective machine learning models, and how to make sure they're effective by evaluating them. And then, we'll discover that in order to evaluate machine learning models. We need to build multiple machine learning datasets so we'll learn how to do that. And then, we'll basically go ahead and do a lab on exploring some data and building a machine learning model to predict the taxi fare amount from one location to another. This is the dataset that we'll use while we are building our machine learning models and evaluating them through the rest of the course.
