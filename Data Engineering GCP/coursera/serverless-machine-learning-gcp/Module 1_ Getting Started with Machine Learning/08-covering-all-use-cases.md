What are the kinds of things that you would have to do? When you collect your data, you have to make sure that the data that you're collecting covers all possible use cases. So for example, let's say you have this issue that you want to look at photographs of the sky and figure out if there are clouds. So you want to take photographs. Let's say you have photographs and you want to figure out if there are clouds. One way to do this is to say, let me go ahead and find a treasure trove of thousands of photographs or millions of photographs and let's see if I can find clouds in them.

That's just data that you have lying around, found data and you hope to make it work.

This doesn't always work well, instead, you have to be purposeful about how you collect the data. So one thing that you might say is, what kinds of clouds are there? And you could go talk to a human expert, and in this case the National Weather Service and NASA have gone out and you'll have all of this taxonomy of clouds, the types of clouds there are. And then you can make sure that in your treasure trove images, all of these types of clouds are actually included in those sets of images. If you hadn't been purposeful, for example, you may not have any images of say tornadoes, or you may not have any images of cirrus clouds. And that might be a problem when you try to go take this model and you put it into production.
