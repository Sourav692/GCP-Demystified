Enhancement
[incubator/fluentd-elasticsearch] Adjust the configMap to allow configurable system.conf

We would like to propose adding the `containers.input.conf` data configuration,
to the `values.yaml` file, so that we can override the default value.

Currently the `containers.input.conf` defines the path as `path /var/log/containers/*.log`
on some Kubernetes environments this path does not exist.
