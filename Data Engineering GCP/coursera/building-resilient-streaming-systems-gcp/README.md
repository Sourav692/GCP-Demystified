# Building Resilient Streaming Systems on Google Cloud Platform

About this course: This 1-week, accelerated on-demand course builds upon Google Cloud Platform Big Data and Machine Learning Fundamentals. Through a combination of video lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on labs, you'll learn how to build streaming data pipelines using Google Cloud Pub/Sub and Dataflow to enable real-time decision making. You will also learn how to build dashboards to render tailored output for various stakeholder audience.

Prerequisites:
• Google Cloud Platform Big Data and Machine Learning Fundamentals (or equivalent experience)
• Some knowledge of Java

Objectives:
• Understand use-cases for real-time streaming analytics
• Use Google Cloud PubSub asynchronous messaging service to manage data events
• Write streaming pipelines and run transformations where necessary
• Get familiar with both sides of a streaming pipeline: production and consumption
• Interoperate Dataflow, BigQuery and Cloud Pub/Sub for real-time streaming and analysis


Welcome to this course on resilient streaming applications on Google Cloud platform. The first chapter is on the architecture of streaming analytics pipelines. This course discusses what stream processing is, how it fits into a big data architecture, when stream processing makes sense, and what Google cloud technologies and products you can choose from to build a resilient streaming data processing solution. We'll also discuss the challenges associated with stream data processing. There are three key challenges: handling variable data volumes, dealing with unordered or late data, and deriving insights from data even as it's streaming in. And in this chapter we'll also do a lab, which is a pen and paper one, where you will fit some typical streaming scenarios into this streaming architecture.
