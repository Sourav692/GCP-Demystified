## Creating Dataproc Clusters
In this lab, you will create, customize and delete Dataproc clusters using the Web console and the command line interface (CLI). You will also connect to the cluster using SSH, and run a couple simple jobs. You will also access the cluster's Hadoop and HDFS services from the browser.

## What you learn
In this lab, you:

* Create a Dataproc cluster from the Web console
* SSH into the cluster and run PySpark jobs
* Add a firewall rule that allows access to your cluster from the browser
* Create, manage and delete Dataproc clusters from the CLI
