Welcome to Google Cloud Platform. This is Grant Moyle. In this video we're going to take a look at leveraging Google Cloud platform for processing our big data jobs on Dataproc and also customize the initialization of our Dataproc master and worker nodes so that we can include other open source software or custom initialization. So far in the Dataproc videos, we have discussed building stateless Hadoop in less than 90 seconds. We've discussed running standard Hadoop, Spark, Pig, and Hive, which are all included in the base Dataproc configuration and submitting jobs by a high level APIs. In this video, we're going to look at customizing the initialization of our Dataproc clusters using scripts or programs that we're going to load into Cloud storage. And we're also going to take a look at how BigQuery and other Google Cloud platform services can be leveraged from Dataproc. So let's look at customizing our cluster.
